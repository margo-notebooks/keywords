# Margo keywords

The Margo syntax for margin notes defines no keywords. Keywords are instead
defined arbitrarily by application developers and other Margo users. To
avoid collisions and support interoperability keywords must be reserved through
a proposal process. Proposals may be submitted through pull requests to the [proposals](proposals) directory.
