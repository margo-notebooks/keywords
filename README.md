# Margo keywords

The Margo syntax for margin notes defines no keywords. Keywords are instead
defined arbitrarily by application developers and other Margo users. To avoid
collisions and support interoperability keywords must be reserved through a
proposal process. Keywords are intended for use in different kinds of
applications, so applications will only use keywords that are relevant to their
functionality. That's OK. This is not a programming language.

The reason keywords should be reserved is to avoid collisions between two
applications that define the same keyword for different purposes. Another
benefit is that two programs that share the same understanding of a keywords can
be used interoperably.
